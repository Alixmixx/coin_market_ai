INTRODUCTION

The CoinMarketCap API is a suite of high-performance RESTful JSON endpoints that are specifically designed to meet the mission-critical demands of application developers, data scientists, and enterprise business platforms.
This API reference includes all technical documentation developers need to integrate third-party applications and platforms. Additional answers to common questions can be found in the CoinMarketCap API FAQ.


QUICK START GUIDE

For developers eager to hit the ground running with the CoinMarketCap API here are a few quick steps to make your first call with the API.
Sign up for a free Developer Portal account. You can sign up at pro.coinmarketcap.com - This is our live production environment with the latest market data. Select the free Basic plan if it meets your needs or upgrade to a paid tier.
Copy your API Key. Once you sign up you'll land on your Developer Portal account dashboard. Copy your API from the API Key box in the top left panel.
Make a test call using your key. You may use the code examples provided below to make a test call with your programming language of choice. This example fetches all active cryptocurrencies by market cap and return market values in USD.
Be sure to replace the API Key in sample code with your own and use API domain pro-api.coinmarketcap.com or use the test API Key b54bcf4d-1bca-4e8e-9a24-22ff2c3d462c for sandbox-api.coinmarketcap.com testing with our sandbox environment. Please note that our sandbox api has mock data and should not be used in your application.
Postman Collection To help with development, we provide a fully featured postman collection that you can import and use immediately! Read more here.

Note: Making HTTP requests on the client side with Javascript is currently prohibited through CORS configuration. This is to protect your API Key which should not be visible to users of your application so your API Key is not stolen. Secure your API Key by routing calls through your own backend service.


AUTHENTICATION



ACQUIRING AN API KEY

All HTTP requests made against the CoinMarketCap API must be validated with an API Key. If you don't have an API Key yet visit the API Developer Portal to register for one.


USING YOUR API KEY

You may use any server side programming language that can make HTTP requests to target the CoinMarketCap API. All requests should target domain https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com.
You can supply your API Key in REST API calls in one of two ways:
Preferred method: Via a custom header named X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY
Convenience method: Via a query string parameter named CMC_PRO_API_KEY
Preferred method: Via a custom header named X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY
Convenience method: Via a query string parameter named CMC_PRO_API_KEY
Security Warning: It's important to secure your API Key against public access. The custom header option is strongly recommended over the querystring option for passing your API Key in a production environment.


API KEY USAGE CREDITS

Most API plans include a daily and monthly limit or "hard cap" to the number of data calls that can be made. This usage is tracked as API "call credits" which are incremented 1:1 against successful (HTTP Status 200) data calls made with your key with these exceptions:
Account management endpoints, usage stats endpoints, and error responses are not included in this limit.
Paginated endpoints: List-based endpoints track an additional call credit for every 100 data points returned (rounded up) beyond our 100 data point defaults. Our lightweight /map endpoints are not included in this limit and always count as 1 credit. See individual endpoint documentation for more details.
Bundled API calls: Many endpoints support resource and currency conversion bundling. Bundled resources are also tracked as 1 call credit for every 100 resources returned (rounded up). Optional currency conversion bundling using the convert parameter also increment an additional API call credit for every conversion requested beyond the first.
Account management endpoints, usage stats endpoints, and error responses are not included in this limit.

Optional currency conversion bundling using the convert parameter also increment an additional API call credit for every conversion requested beyond the first.
You can log in to the Developer Portal to view live stats on your API Key usage and limits including the number of credits used for each call. You can also find call credit usage in the JSON response for each API call. See the status object for details. You may also use the /key/info endpoint to quickly review your usage and when daily/monthly credits reset directly from the API.
Note: "day" and "month" credit usage periods are defined relative to your API subscription. For example, if your monthly subscription started on the 5th at 5:30am, this billing anchor is also when your monthly credits refresh each month. The free Basic tier resets each day at UTC midnight and each calendar month at UTC midnight.


ENDPOINT OVERVIEW



THE COINMARKETCAP API IS DIVIDED INTO 8 TOP-LEVEL CATEGORIES



ENDPOINT PATHS FOLLOW A PATTERN MATCHING THE TYPE OF DATA PROVIDED



CRYPTOCURRENCY AND EXCHANGE ENDPOINTS PROVIDE 2 DIFFERENT WAYS OF ACCESSING DATA DEPENDING ON PURPOSE

Listing endpoints: Flexible paginated */listings/* endpoints allow you to sort and filter lists of data like cryptocurrencies by market cap or exchanges by volume.
Item endpoints: Convenient ID-based resource endpoints like */quotes/* and */market-pairs/* allow you to bundle several IDs; for example, this allows you to get latest market quotes for a specific set of cryptocurrencies in one call.

Item endpoints: Convenient ID-based resource endpoints like */quotes/* and */market-pairs/* allow you to bundle several IDs; for example, this allows you to get latest market quotes for a specific set of cryptocurrencies in one call.


STANDARDS AND CONVENTIONS

Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json. You should also send an Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip header to receive data fast and efficiently.


ENDPOINT RESPONSE PAYLOAD FORMAT

All endpoints return data in JSON format with the results of your query under data if the call is successful.
A Status object is always included for both successful calls and failures when possible. The Status object always includes the current time on the server when the call was executed as timestamp, the number of API call credits this call utilized as credit_count, and the number of milliseconds it took to process the request as elapsed. Any details about errors encountered can be found under the error_code and error_message. See Errors and Rate Limits for details on errors.


CRYPTOCURRENCY, EXCHANGE, AND FIAT CURRENCY IDENTIFIERS

Cryptocurrencies may be identified in endpoints using either the cryptocurrency's unique CoinMarketCap ID as id (eg. id=1 for Bitcoin) or the cryptocurrency's symbol (eg. symbol=BTC for Bitcoin). For a current list of supported cryptocurrencies use our /cryptocurrency/map call.
Exchanges may be identified in endpoints using either the exchange's unique CoinMarketCap ID as id (eg. id=270 for Binance) or the exchange's web slug (eg. slug=binance for Binance). For a current list of supported exchanges use our /exchange/map call.
All fiat currency options use the standard ISO 8601 currency code (eg. USD for the US Dollar). For a current list of supported fiat currencies use our /fiat/map endpoint. Unless otherwise stated, endpoints with fiat currency options like our convert parameter support these 93 major currency codes:

Along with these four precious metals:
Warning: Using CoinMarketCap IDs is always recommended as not all cryptocurrency symbols are unique. They can also change with a cryptocurrency rebrand. If a symbol is used the API will always default to the cryptocurrency with the highest market cap if there are multiple matches. Our convert parameter also defaults to fiat if a cryptocurrency symbol also matches a supported fiat currency. You may use the convenient /map endpoints to quickly find the corresponding CoinMarketCap ID for a cryptocurrency or exchange.


BUNDLING API CALLS

Many endpoints support ID and crypto/fiat currency conversion bundling. This means you can pass multiple comma-separated values to an endpoint to query or convert several items at once. Check the id, symbol, slug, and convert query parameter descriptions in the endpoint documentation to see if this is supported for an endpoint.
Endpoints that support bundling return data as an object map instead of an array. Each key-value pair will use the identifier you passed in as the key.

Endpoints that support bundling return data as an object map instead of an array. Each key-value pair will use the identifier you passed in as the key.
For example, if you passed symbol=BTC,ETH to /v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest you would receive:
Or if you passed id=1,1027 you would receive:
Price conversions that are returned inside endpoint responses behave in the same fashion. These are enclosed in a quote object.


DATE AND TIME FORMATS

All endpoints that require date/time parameters allow timestamps to be passed in either ISO 8601 format (eg. 2018-06-06T01:46:40Z) or in Unix time (eg. 1528249600). Timestamps that are passed in ISO 8601 format support basic and extended notations; if a timezone is not included, UTC will be the default.
All timestamps returned in JSON payloads are returned in UTC time using human-readable ISO 8601 format which follows this pattern: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.mmmZ. The final .mmm designates milliseconds. Per the ISO 8601 spec the final Z is a constant that represents UTC time.
Data is collected, recorded, and reported in UTC time unless otherwise specified.

VERSIONING

The CoinMarketCap API is versioned to guarantee new features and updates are non-breaking. The latest version of this API is /v1/.


ERRORS AND RATE LIMITS



API REQUEST THROTTLING

Use of the CoinMarketCap API is subject to API call rate limiting or "request throttling". This is the number of HTTP calls that can be made simultaneously or within the same minute with your API Key before receiving an HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" throttling error. This limit scales with the usage tier and resets every 60 seconds. Please review our Best Practices for implementation strategies that work well with rate limiting.


HTTP STATUS CODES

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call.
400 (Bad Request) The server could not process the request, likely due to an invalid argument.
401 (Unauthorized) Your request lacks valid authentication credentials, likely an issue with your API Key.
402 (Payment Required) Your API request was rejected due to it being a paid subscription plan with an overdue balance. Pay the balance in the Developer Portal billing tab and it will be enabled.
403 (Forbidden) Your request was rejected due to a permission issue, likely a restriction on the API Key's associated service plan. Here is a convenient map of service plans to endpoints.
429 (Too Many Requests) The API Key's rate limit was exceeded; consider slowing down your API Request frequency if this is an HTTP request throttling error. Consider upgrading your service plan if you have reached your monthly API call credit limit for the day/month.
500 (Internal Server Error) An unexpected server issue was encountered.
400 (Bad Request) The server could not process the request, likely due to an invalid argument.

ERROR RESPONSE CODES

A Status object is always included in the JSON response payload for both successful calls and failures when possible. During error scenarios you may reference the error_code and error_message properties of the Status object. One of the API error codes below will be returned if applicable otherwise the HTTP status code for the general error type is returned.


BEST PRACTICES

This section contains a few recommendations on how to efficiently utilize the CoinMarketCap API for your enterprise application, particularly if you already have a large base of users for your application.


USE COINMARKETCAP ID INSTEAD OF CRYPTOCURRENCY SYMBOL

Utilizing common cryptocurrency symbols to reference cryptocurrencies on the API is easy and convenient but brittle. You should know that many cryptocurrencies have the same symbol, for example, there are currently three cryptocurrencies that commonly refer to themselves by the symbol HOT. Cryptocurrency symbols also often change with cryptocurrency rebrands. When fetching cryptocurrency by a symbol that matches several active cryptocurrencies we return the one with the highest market cap at the time of the query. To ensure you always target the cryptocurrency you expect, use our permanent CoinMarketCap IDs. These IDs are used reliably by numerous mission critical platforms and never change.
We make fetching a map of all active cryptocurrencies' CoinMarketCap IDs very easy. Just call our /cryptocurrency/map endpoint to receive a list of all active currencies mapped to the unique id property. This map also includes other typical identifiying properties like name, symbol and platform token_address that can be cross referenced. In cryptocurrency calls you would then send, for example id=1027, instead of symbol=ETH. It's strongly recommended that any production code utilize these IDs for cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and markets to future-proof your code.


USE THE RIGHT ENDPOINTS FOR THE JOB

You may have noticed that /cryptocurrency/listings/latest and /cryptocurrency/quotes/latest return the same crypto data but in different formats. This is because the former is for requesting paginated and ordered lists of all cryptocurrencies while the latter is for selectively requesting only the specific cryptocurrencies you require. Many endpoints follow this pattern, allow the design of these endpoints to work for you!


IMPLEMENT A CACHING STRATEGY IF NEEDED

There are standard legal data safeguards built into the Commercial User Terms that application developers should keep in mind. These Terms help prevent unauthorized scraping and redistributing of CMC data but are intentionally worded to allow legitimate local caching of market data to support the operation of your application. If your application has a significant user base and you are concerned with staying within the call credit and API throttling limits of your subscription plan consider implementing a data caching strategy.
For example instead of making a /cryptocurrency/quotes/latest call every time one of your application's users needs to fetch market rates for specific cryptocurrencies, you could pre-fetch and cache the latest market data for every cryptocurrency in your application's local database every 60 seconds. This would only require 1 API call, /cryptocurrency/listings/latest?limit=5000, every 60 seconds. Then, anytime one of your application's users need to load a custom list of cryptocurrencies you could simply pull this latest market data from your local cache without the overhead of additional calls. This kind of optimization is practical for customers with large, demanding user bases.


CODE DEFENSIVELY TO ENSURE A ROBUST REST API INTEGRATION

Whenever implementing any high availability REST API service for mission critical operations it's recommended to code defensively. Since the API is versioned, any breaking request or response format change would only be introduced through new versions of each endpoint, however existing endpoints may still introduce new convenience properties over time.
We suggest these best practices:
You should parse the API response JSON as JSON and not through a regular expression or other means to avoid brittle parsing logic.
Your parsing code should explicitly parse only the response properties you require to guarantee new fields that may be returned in the future are ignored.
You should add robust field validation to your response parsing logic. You can wrap complex field parsing, like dates, in try/catch statements to minimize the impact of unexpected parsing issues (like the unlikely return of a null value).
Implement a "Retry with exponential backoff" coding pattern for your REST API call logic. This means if your HTTP request happens to get rate limited (HTTP 429) or encounters an unexpected server-side condition (HTTP 5xx) your code would automatically recover and try again using an intelligent recovery scheme. You may use one of the many libraries available; for example, this one for Node or this one for Python.

VERSION HISTORY

The CoinMarketCap API utilizes Semantic Versioning in the format major.minor.patch. The current major version is incorporated into the API request path as /v1/. Non-breaking minor and patch updates to the API are released regularly. These may include new endpoints, data points, and API plan features which are always introduced in a non-breaking manner. This means you can expect new properties to become available in our existing /v1/ endpoints however any breaking change will be introduced under a new major version of the API with legacy versions supported indefinitely unless otherwise stated.

The Category ID. This can be found using the Categories API.
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of coins to return.
Optionally specify the number of coins to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

COINMARKETCAP ID MAP

Returns a mapping of all cryptocurrencies to unique CoinMarketCap ids. Per our Best Practices we recommend utilizing CMC ID instead of cryptocurrency symbols to securely identify cryptocurrencies with our other endpoints and in your own application logic.  Each cryptocurrency returned includes typical identifiers such as name, symbol, and token_address for flexible mapping to id.
By default this endpoint returns cryptocurrencies that have actively tracked markets on supported exchanges. You may receive a map of all inactive cryptocurrencies by passing listing_status=inactive. You may also receive a map of registered cryptocurrency projects that are listed but do not yet meet methodology requirements to have tracked markets via listing_status=untracked. Please review our methodology documentation for additional details on listing states.
Cryptocurrencies returned include first_historical_data and last_historical_data timestamps to conveniently reference historical date ranges available to query with historical time-series data endpoints. You may also use the aux parameter to only include properties you require to slim down the payload if calling this endpoint frequently.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Mapping data is updated only as needed, every 30 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 API call credit per request no matter query size.
CMC equivalent pages: No equivalent, this data is only available via API.

METADATA V2

Returns all static metadata available for one or more cryptocurrencies. This information includes details like logo, description, official website URL, social links, and links to a cryptocurrency's technical documentation.
Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Startup
Hobbyist
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Static data is updated only as needed, every 30 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 cryptocurrencies returned (rounded up).
CMC equivalent pages: Cryptocurrency detail page metadata like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/.

CMC equivalent pages: Cryptocurrency detail page metadata like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/.
One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs. Example: "1,2"
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request. Please note that starting in the v2 endpoint, due to the fact that a symbol is not unique, if you request by symbol each data response will contain an array of objects containing all of the coins that use each requested symbol. The v1 endpoint will still return a single object, the highest ranked coin using that symbol.
Alternatively pass in a contract address. Example: "0xc40af1e4fecfa05ce6bab79dcd8b373d2e436c4e"
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass urls,logo,description,tags,platform,date_added,notice,status to include all auxiliary fields.

LISTINGS HISTORICAL

Returns a ranked and sorted list of all cryptocurrencies for a historical UTC date.
Technical Notes

This endpoint is identical in format to our /cryptocurrency/listings/latest endpoint but is used to retrieve historical daily ranking snapshots from the end of each UTC day.
Daily snapshots reflect market data at the end of each UTC day and may be requested as far back as 2013-04-28 (as supported by your plan's historical limits).
The required "date" parameter can be passed as a Unix timestamp or ISO 8601 date but only the date portion of the timestamp will be referenced. It is recommended to send an ISO date format like "2019-10-10" without time.
This endpoint is for retrieving paginated and sorted lists of all currencies. If you require historical market data on specific cryptocurrencies you should use /cryptocurrency/quotes/historical.

Cryptocurrencies are listed by cmc_rank by default. You may optionally sort against any of the following:
cmc_rank: CoinMarketCap's market cap rank as outlined in our methodology.
name: The cryptocurrency name.
symbol: The cryptocurrency symbol.
market_cap: market cap (latest trade price x circulating supply).
price: latest average trade price across markets.
circulating_supply: approximate number of coins currently in circulation.
total_supply: approximate total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).
max_supply: our best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the currency.
num_market_pairs: number of market pairs across all exchanges trading each currency.
volume_24h: 24 hour trading volume for each currency.
percent_change_1h: 1 hour trading price percentage change for each currency.
percent_change_24h: 24 hour trading price percentage change for each currency.
percent_change_7d: 7 day trading price percentage change for each currency.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist (1 month)
Startup (1 month)
Standard (3 month)
Professional (12 months)
Enterprise (Up to 6 years)

Cache / Update frequency: The last completed UTC day is available 30 minutes after midnight on the next UTC day.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 cryptocurrencies returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical daily crypto ranking snapshot pages like this one on February 02, 2014.

Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
What field to sort the list of cryptocurrencies by.
The direction in which to order cryptocurrencies against the specified sort.
The type of cryptocurrency to include.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass platform,tags,date_added,circulating_supply,total_supply,max_supply,cmc_rank,num_market_pairs to include all auxiliary fields.

LISTINGS LATEST

Returns a paginated list of all active cryptocurrencies with latest market data. The default "market_cap" sort returns cryptocurrency in order of CoinMarketCap's market cap rank (as outlined in our methodology) but you may configure this call to order by another market ranking field. Use the "convert" option to return market values in multiple fiat and cryptocurrency conversions in the same call.
You may sort against any of the following:
market_cap: CoinMarketCap's market cap rank as outlined in our methodology.
market_cap_strict: A strict market cap sort (latest trade price x circulating supply).
name: The cryptocurrency name.
symbol: The cryptocurrency symbol.
date_added: Date cryptocurrency was added to the system.
price: latest average trade price across markets.
circulating_supply: approximate number of coins currently in circulation.
total_supply: approximate total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).
max_supply: our best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the currency.
num_market_pairs: number of market pairs across all exchanges trading each currency.
market_cap_by_total_supply_strict: market cap by total supply.
volume_24h: rolling 24 hour adjusted trading volume.
volume_7d: rolling 24 hour adjusted trading volume.
volume_30d: rolling 24 hour adjusted trading volume.
percent_change_1h: 1 hour trading price percentage change for each currency.
percent_change_24h: 24 hour trading price percentage change for each currency.
percent_change_7d: 7 day trading price percentage change for each currency.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 60 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 200 cryptocurrencies returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our latest cryptocurrency listing and ranking pages like coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/, coinmarketcap.com/tokens/, coinmarketcap.com/gainers-losers/, coinmarketcap.com/new/.
NOTE: Use this endpoint if you need a sorted and paginated list of all cryptocurrencies. If you want to query for market data on a few specific cryptocurrencies use /v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest which is optimized for that purpose. The response data between these endpoints is otherwise the same.

Optionally specify a threshold of maximum 24 hour percent change to filter results by.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
What field to sort the list of cryptocurrencies by.
The direction in which to order cryptocurrencies against the specified sort.
The type of cryptocurrency to include.
The tag of cryptocurrency to include.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass num_market_pairs,cmc_rank,date_added,tags,platform,max_supply,circulating_supply,total_supply,market_cap_by_total_supply,volume_24h_reported,volume_7d,volume_7d_reported,volume_30d,volume_30d_reported,is_market_cap_included_in_calc to include all auxiliary fields.

NOTE: Use this endpoint if you need a sorted and paginated list of all recently added cryptocurrencies.
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
The direction in which to order cryptocurrencies against the specified sort.

CMC equivalent pages: Our cryptocurrency Gainers & Losers page coinmarketcap.com/gainers-losers/.
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
Adjusts the overall window of time for the biggest gainers and losers.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
What field to sort the list of cryptocurrencies by.
The direction in which to order cryptocurrencies against the specified sort.

CMC equivalent pages: Our cryptocurrency Trending page coinmarketcap.com/trending-cryptocurrencies/.
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
Adjusts the overall window of time for the latest trending coins.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

CMC equivalent pages: The CoinMarketCap “Most Visited” trending list. coinmarketcap.com/most-viewed-pages/.
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
Adjusts the overall window of time for most visited currencies.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

MARKET PAIRS LATEST V2

Lists all active market pairs that CoinMarketCap tracks for a given cryptocurrency or fiat currency. All markets with this currency as the pair base or pair quote will be returned. The latest price and volume information is returned for each market. Use the "convert" option to return market values in multiple fiat and cryptocurrency conversions in the same call.
Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 1 minute.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 market pairs returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our active cryptocurrency markets pages like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets.

A cryptocurrency or fiat currency by CoinMarketCap ID to list market pairs for. Example: "1"
Alternatively pass a cryptocurrency by slug. Example: "bitcoin"
Alternatively pass a cryptocurrency by symbol. Fiat currencies are not supported by this field. Example: "BTC". A single cryptocurrency "id", "slug", or "symbol" is required.
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
Optionally specify the sort direction of markets returned.
Optionally specify the sort order of markets returned. By default we return a strict sort on 24 hour reported volume. Pass cmc_rank to return a CMC methodology based sort where markets with excluded volumes are returned last.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass num_market_pairs,category,fee_type,market_url,currency_name,currency_slug,price_quote,notice,cmc_rank,effective_liquidity,market_score,market_reputation to include all auxiliary fields.
Optionally include one or more fiat or cryptocurrency IDs to filter market pairs by. For example ?id=1&matched_id=2781 would only return BTC markets that matched: "BTC/USD" or "USD/BTC". This parameter cannot be used when matched_symbol is used.
Optionally include one or more fiat or cryptocurrency symbols to filter market pairs by. For example ?symbol=BTC&matched_symbol=USD would only return BTC markets that matched: "BTC/USD" or "USD/BTC". This parameter cannot be used when matched_id is used.
The category of trading this market falls under. Spot markets are the most common but options include derivatives and OTC.
The fee type the exchange enforces for this market.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

OHLCV HISTORICAL V2

Returns historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data along with market cap for any cryptocurrency using time interval parameters. Currently daily and hourly OHLCV periods are supported. Volume is not currently supported for hourly OHLCV intervals before 2020-09-22.
Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here. 
Technical Notes

Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time for this "time_period".
One OHLCV quote will be returned for every "time_period" between your "time_start" (exclusive) and "time_end" (inclusive).
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "time_period" will be calculated in reverse from "time_end" using the "count" parameter which defaults to 10 results.
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
If you don't need every "time_period" between your dates you may adjust the frequency that "time_period" is sampled using the "interval" parameter. For example with "time_period" set to "daily" you may set "interval" to "2d" to get the daily OHLCV for every other day. You could set "interval" to "monthly" to get the first daily OHLCV for each month, or set it to "yearly" to get the daily OHLCV value against the same date every year.

Implementation Tips

If querying for a specific OHLCV date your "time_start" should specify a timestamp of 1 interval prior as "time_start" is an exclusive time parameter (as opposed to "time_end" which is inclusive to the search). This means that when you pass a "time_start" results will be returned for the next complete "time_period". For example, if you are querying for a daily OHLCV datapoint for 2018-11-30 your "time_start" should be "2018-11-29".
If only specifying a "count" parameter to return latest OHLCV periods, your "count" should be 1 number higher than the number of results you expect to receive. "Count" defines the number of "time_period" intervals queried, not the number of results to return, and this includes the currently active time period which is incomplete when working backwards from current time. For example, if you want the last daily OHLCV value available simply pass "count=2" to skip the incomplete active time period.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.

Interval Options
There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "time_period" and "interval" parameters. For "time_period" these return aggregate OHLCV data from the beginning to end of each interval period. Apply these time intervals to "interval" to adjust how frequently "time_period" is sampled.
The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Hour intervals in UTC.
"daily" - Calendar day intervals for each UTC day.
"weekly" - Calendar week intervals for each calendar week.
"monthly" - Calendar month intervals for each calendar month.
"yearly" - Calendar year intervals for each calendar year.
The second are relative time intervals.
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Time periods that repeat every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".
Please note that "time_period" currently supports the "daily" and "hourly" options. "interval" supports all interval options.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 OHLCV data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical cryptocurrency data pages like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/.
One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs. Example: "1,1027"
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request.
Time period to return OHLCV data for. The default is "daily". If hourly, the open will be 01:00 and the close will be 01:59. If daily, the open will be 00:00:00 for the day and close will be 23:59:99 for the same day. See the main endpoint description for details.
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to start returning OHLCV time periods for. Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time.
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to stop returning OHLCV time periods for (inclusive). Optional, if not passed we'll default to the current time. Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time.
Optionally limit the number of time periods to return results for. The default is 10 items. The current query limit is 10000 items.
Optionally adjust the interval that "time_period" is sampled. For example with interval=monthly&time_period=daily you will see a daily OHLCV record for January, February, March and so on. See main endpoint description for available options.
By default market quotes are returned in USD. Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 3 fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

OHLCV LATEST V2

Returns the latest OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) market values for one or more cryptocurrencies for the current UTC day. Since the current UTC day is still active these values are updated frequently. You can find the final calculated OHLCV values for the last completed UTC day along with all historic days using /cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical.
Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 10 minutes. Additional OHLCV intervals and 1 minute updates will be available in the future.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 OHLCV values returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: No equivalent, this data is only available via API.

CMC equivalent pages: No equivalent, this data is only available via API.
One or more comma-separated cryptocurrency CoinMarketCap IDs. Example: 1,2
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "symbol" is required.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

PRICE PERFORMANCE STATS V2

Returns price performance statistics for one or more cryptocurrencies including launch price ROI and all-time high / all-time low. Stats are returned for an all_time period by default. UTC yesterday and a number of rolling time periods may be requested using the time_period parameter. Utilize the convert parameter to translate values into multiple fiats or cryptocurrencies using historical rates.
Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 60 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 cryptocurrencies returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: The statistics module displayed on cryptocurrency pages like Bitcoin.
NOTE: You may also use /cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical for traditional OHLCV data at historical daily and hourly intervals. You may also use /v1/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/latest for OHLCV data for the current UTC day.

One or more comma-separated cryptocurrency CoinMarketCap IDs. Example: 1,2
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request.
Specify one or more comma-delimited time periods to return stats for. all_time is the default. Pass all_time,yesterday,24h,7d,30d,90d,365d to return all supported time periods. All rolling periods have a rolling close time of the current request time. For example 24h would have a close time of now and an open time of 24 hours before now. Please note: yesterday is a UTC period and currently does not currently support high and low timestamps.
Optionally calculate quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if no match is found for 1 or more requested cryptocurrencies. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

QUOTES HISTORICAL V2

Returns an interval of historic market quotes for any cryptocurrency based on time and interval parameters.
Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.
Technical Notes

A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.

Implementation Tips

Want to get the last quote of each UTC day? Don't use "interval=daily" as that returns the first quote. Instead use "interval=24h" to repeat a specific timestamp search every 24 hours and pass ex. "time_start=2019-01-04T23:59:00.000Z" to query for the last record of each UTC day.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.

Interval Options 
There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".
The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
"daily" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
"weekly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
"monthly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
"yearly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.
The second are relative time intervals.
"m": Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Get the first quote available every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist (1 month)
Startup (1 month)
Standard (3 month)
Professional (12 months)
Enterprise (Up to 6 years)

Cache / Update frequency: Every 5 minutes.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 historical data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical cryptocurrency charts like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts.

Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 historical data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical cryptocurrency charts like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts.
One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs. Example: "1,2"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "symbol" is required for this request.
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to start returning quotes for. Optional, if not passed, we'll return quotes calculated in reverse from "time_end".
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to stop returning quotes for (inclusive). Optional, if not passed, we'll default to the current time. If no "time_start" is passed, we return quotes in reverse order starting from this time.
The number of interval periods to return results for. Optional, required if both "time_start" and "time_end" aren't supplied. The default is 10 items. The current query limit is 10000.
Interval of time to return data points for. See details in endpoint description.
By default market quotes are returned in USD. Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 3 other fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass price,volume,market_cap,circulating_supply,total_supply,quote_timestamp,is_active,is_fiat,search_interval to include all auxiliary fields.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if no match is found for 1 or more requested cryptocurrencies. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

QUOTES LATEST V2

Returns the latest market quote for 1 or more cryptocurrencies. Use the "convert" option to return market values in multiple fiat and cryptocurrency conversions in the same call.
Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Startup
Hobbyist
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 60 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 cryptocurrencies returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Latest market data pages for specific cryptocurrencies like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/.
NOTE: Use this endpoint to request the latest quote for specific cryptocurrencies. If you need to request all cryptocurrencies use /v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest which is optimized for that purpose. The response data between these endpoints is otherwise the same.

One or more comma-separated cryptocurrency CoinMarketCap IDs. Example: 1,2
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass num_market_pairs,cmc_rank,date_added,tags,platform,max_supply,circulating_supply,total_supply,market_cap_by_total_supply,volume_24h_reported,volume_7d,volume_7d_reported,volume_30d,volume_30d_reported,is_active,is_fiat to include all auxiliary fields.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if no match is found for 1 or more requested cryptocurrencies. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

QUOTES HISTORICAL V3

Returns an interval of historic market quotes for any cryptocurrency based on time and interval parameters.
Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V3 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.
Technical Notes

A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.

Implementation Tips

Want to get the last quote of each UTC day? Don't use "interval=daily" as that returns the first quote. Instead use "interval=24h" to repeat a specific timestamp search every 24 hours and pass ex. "time_start=2019-01-04T23:59:00.000Z" to query for the last record of each UTC day.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.

Interval Options 
There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".
The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
"daily" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
"weekly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
"monthly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
"yearly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.
The second are relative time intervals.
"m": Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Get the first quote available every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist (1 month)
Startup (1 month)
Standard (3 month)
Professional (12 months)
Enterprise (Up to 6 years)

Cache / Update frequency: Every 5 minutes.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 historical data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical cryptocurrency charts like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts.

Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 historical data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical cryptocurrency charts like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts.
One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs. Example: "1,2"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "symbol" is required for this request.
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to start returning quotes for. Optional, if not passed, we'll return quotes calculated in reverse from "time_end".
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to stop returning quotes for (inclusive). Optional, if not passed, we'll default to the current time. If no "time_start" is passed, we return quotes in reverse order starting from this time.
The number of interval periods to return results for. Optional, required if both "time_start" and "time_end" aren't supplied. The default is 10 items. The current query limit is 10000.
Interval of time to return data points for. See details in endpoint description.
By default market quotes are returned in USD. Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 3 other fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass price,volume,market_cap,circulating_supply,total_supply,quote_timestamp,is_active,is_fiat,search_interval to include all auxiliary fields.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if no match is found for 1 or more requested cryptocurrencies. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

COINMARKETCAP ID MAP

Returns a paginated list of all active cryptocurrency exchanges by CoinMarketCap ID. We recommend using this convenience endpoint to lookup and utilize our unique exchange id across all endpoints as typical exchange identifiers may change over time. As a convenience you may pass a comma-separated list of exchanges by slug to filter this list to only those you require or the aux parameter to slim down the payload.
By default this endpoint returns exchanges that have at least 1 actively tracked market. You may receive a map of all inactive cryptocurrencies by passing listing_status=inactive. You may also receive a map of registered exchanges that are listed but do not yet meet methodology requirements to have tracked markets available via listing_status=untracked. Please review (3) Listing Tiers in our methodology documentation for additional details on listing states.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Mapping data is updated only as needed, every 30 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per call.
CMC equivalent pages: No equivalent, this data is only available via API.

CMC equivalent pages: No equivalent, this data is only available via API.
Only active exchanges are returned by default. Pass inactive to get a list of exchanges that are no longer active. Pass untracked to get a list of exchanges that are registered but do not currently meet methodology requirements to have active markets tracked. You may pass one or more comma-separated values.
Optionally pass a comma-separated list of exchange slugs (lowercase URL friendly shorthand name with spaces replaced with dashes) to return CoinMarketCap IDs for. If this option is passed, other options will be ignored.
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
What field to sort the list of exchanges by.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass first_historical_data,last_historical_data,is_active,status to include all auxiliary fields.
Optionally include one fiat or cryptocurrency IDs to filter market pairs by. For example ?crypto_id=1 would only return exchanges that have BTC.

LISTINGS LATEST

Returns a paginated list of all cryptocurrency exchanges including the latest aggregate market data for each exchange. Use the "convert" option to return market values in multiple fiat and cryptocurrency conversions in the same call.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 1 minute.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 exchanges returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our latest exchange listing and ranking pages like coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/.
NOTE: Use this endpoint if you need a sorted and paginated list of exchanges. If you want to query for market data on a few specific exchanges use /v1/exchange/quotes/latest which is optimized for that purpose. The response data between these endpoints is otherwise the same.

Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
What field to sort the list of exchanges by.
The direction in which to order exchanges against the specified sort.
The type of exchange markets to include in rankings. This field is deprecated. Please use "all" for accurate sorting.
The category for this exchange.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass num_market_pairs,traffic_score,rank,exchange_score,effective_liquidity_24h,date_launched,fiats to include all auxiliary fields.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

CMC equivalent pages: Our exchange level active markets pages like coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/.
A CoinMarketCap exchange ID. Example: "1"
Alternatively pass an exchange "slug" (URL friendly all lowercase shorthand version of name with spaces replaced with hyphens). Example: "binance". One "id" or "slug" is required.
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass num_market_pairs,category,fee_type,market_url,currency_name,currency_slug,price_quote,effective_liquidity,market_score,market_reputation to include all auxiliary fields.
Optionally include one or more comma-delimited fiat or cryptocurrency IDs to filter market pairs by. For example ?matched_id=2781 would only return BTC markets that matched: "BTC/USD" or "USD/BTC" for the requested exchange. This parameter cannot be used when matched_symbol is used.
Optionally include one or more comma-delimited fiat or cryptocurrency symbols to filter market pairs by. For example ?matched_symbol=USD would only return BTC markets that matched: "BTC/USD" or "USD/BTC" for the requested exchange. This parameter cannot be used when matched_id is used.
The category of trading this market falls under. Spot markets are the most common but options include derivatives and OTC.
The fee type the exchange enforces for this market.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

QUOTES HISTORICAL

Returns an interval of historic quotes for any exchange based on time and interval parameters.
Technical Notes

A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple exchanges in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.

Interval Options 
There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".
The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
"daily" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
"weekly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
"monthly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
"yearly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.
The second are relative time intervals.
"m": Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Get the first quote available every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist (1 month)
Startup (1 month)
Standard (3 month)
Professional (Up to 12 months)
Enterprise (Up to 6 years)

Note: You may use the /exchange/map endpoint to receive a list of earliest historical dates that may be fetched for each exchange as  first_historical_data. This timestamp will either be the date CoinMarketCap first started tracking the exchange or 2018-04-26T00:45:00.000Z, the earliest date this type of historical data is available for.
Cache / Update frequency: Every 5 minutes.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 historical data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: No equivalent, this data is only available via API outside of our volume sparkline charts in coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/.

Note: You may use the /exchange/map endpoint to receive a list of earliest historical dates that may be fetched for each exchange as  first_historical_data. This timestamp will either be the date CoinMarketCap first started tracking the exchange or 2018-04-26T00:45:00.000Z, the earliest date this type of historical data is available for.
Cache / Update frequency: Every 5 minutes.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 historical data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: No equivalent, this data is only available via API outside of our volume sparkline charts in coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/.
One or more comma-separated exchange CoinMarketCap ids. Example: "24,270"
Alternatively, one or more comma-separated exchange names in URL friendly shorthand "slug" format (all lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens). Example: "binance,kraken". At least one "id" or "slug" is required.
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to start returning quotes for. Optional, if not passed, we'll return quotes calculated in reverse from "time_end".
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to stop returning quotes for (inclusive). Optional, if not passed, we'll default to the current time. If no "time_start" is passed, we return quotes in reverse order starting from this time.
The number of interval periods to return results for. Optional, required if both "time_start" and "time_end" aren't supplied. The default is 10 items. The current query limit is 10000.
Interval of time to return data points for. See details in endpoint description.
By default market quotes are returned in USD. Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 3 other fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

QUOTES HISTORICAL

Returns an interval of historical global cryptocurrency market metrics based on time and interval parameters.
Technical Notes

A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.

Interval Options 
There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".
The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
"daily" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
"weekly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
"monthly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
"yearly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.
The second are relative time intervals.
"m": Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Get the first quote available every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".

Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to start returning quotes for. Optional, if not passed, we'll return quotes calculated in reverse from "time_end".
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to stop returning quotes for (inclusive). Optional, if not passed, we'll default to the current time. If no "time_start" is passed, we return quotes in reverse order starting from this time.
The number of interval periods to return results for. Optional, required if both "time_start" and "time_end" aren't supplied. The default is 10 items. The current query limit is 10000.
Interval of time to return data points for. See details in endpoint description.
By default market quotes are returned in USD. Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 3 other fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass btc_dominance,eth_dominance,active_cryptocurrencies,active_exchanges,active_market_pairs,total_volume_24h,total_volume_24h_reported,altcoin_market_cap,altcoin_volume_24h,altcoin_volume_24h_reported,search_interval to include all auxiliary fields.

CMC equivalent pages: The latest aggregate global market stats ticker across all CMC pages like coinmarketcap.com.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

PRICE CONVERSION V2

Convert an amount of one cryptocurrency or fiat currency into one or more different currencies utilizing the latest market rate for each currency. You may optionally pass a historical timestamp as time to convert values based on historical rates (as your API plan supports).
Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.
Technical Notes

Latest market rate conversions are accurate to 1 minute of specificity. Historical conversions are accurate to 1 minute of specificity outside of non-USD fiat conversions which have 5 minute specificity.
You may reference a current list of all supported cryptocurrencies via the cryptocurrency/map endpoint. This endpoint also returns the supported date ranges for historical conversions via the first_historical_data and last_historical_data properties.
Conversions are supported in 93 different fiat currencies and 4 precious metals as outlined here. Historical fiat conversions are supported as far back as 2013-04-28.
A last_updated timestamp is included for both your source currency and each conversion currency. This is the timestamp of the closest market rate record referenced for each currency during the conversion.

This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic (Latest market price conversions)
Hobbyist (Latest market price conversions + 1 month historical)
Startup (Latest market price conversions + 1 month historical)
Standard (Latest market price conversions + 3 months historical)
Professional (Latest market price conversions + 12 months historical)
Enterprise (Latest market price conversions + up to 6 years historical)

Cache / Update frequency: Every 60 seconds for the lastest cryptocurrency and fiat currency rates.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per call and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our cryptocurrency conversion page at coinmarketcap.com/converter/.

An amount of currency to convert. Example: 10.43
The CoinMarketCap currency ID of the base cryptocurrency or fiat to convert from. Example: "1"
Alternatively the currency symbol of the base cryptocurrency or fiat to convert from. Example: "BTC". One "id" or "symbol" is required. Please note that starting in the v2 endpoint, due to the fact that a symbol is not unique, if you request by symbol each quote response will contain an array of objects containing all of the coins that use each requested symbol. The v1 endpoint will still return a single object, the highest ranked coin using that symbol.
Optional timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to reference historical pricing during conversion. If not passed, the current time will be used. If passed, we'll reference the closest historic values available for this conversion.
Pass up to 120 comma-separated fiat or cryptocurrency symbols to convert the source amount to.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

DEPRECATED

Deprecated (V1) Endpoints
These endpoints have been replaced with their V2 versions, and are no longer being actively supported.
We strongly suggest migrating to V2 endpoints, and this documentation only exists for legacy purposes.

METADATA V1 (DEPRECATED)

Returns all static metadata available for one or more cryptocurrencies. This information includes details like logo, description, official website URL, social links, and links to a cryptocurrency's technical documentation.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Startup
Hobbyist
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Static data is updated only as needed, every 30 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 cryptocurrencies returned (rounded up).
CMC equivalent pages: Cryptocurrency detail page metadata like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/.

Cache / Update frequency: Static data is updated only as needed, every 30 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 cryptocurrencies returned (rounded up).
CMC equivalent pages: Cryptocurrency detail page metadata like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/.
One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs. Example: "1,2"
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request. Please note that starting in the v2 endpoint, due to the fact that a symbol is not unique, if you request by symbol each data response will contain an array of objects containing all of the coins that use each requested symbol. The v1 endpoint will still return a single object, the highest ranked coin using that symbol.
Alternatively pass in a contract address. Example: "0xc40af1e4fecfa05ce6bab79dcd8b373d2e436c4e"
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass urls,logo,description,tags,platform,date_added,notice,status to include all auxiliary fields.

PRICE CONVERSION V1 (DEPRECATED)

Convert an amount of one cryptocurrency or fiat currency into one or more different currencies utilizing the latest market rate for each currency. You may optionally pass a historical timestamp as time to convert values based on historical rates (as your API plan supports).
Technical Notes

Latest market rate conversions are accurate to 1 minute of specificity. Historical conversions are accurate to 1 minute of specificity outside of non-USD fiat conversions which have 5 minute specificity.
You may reference a current list of all supported cryptocurrencies via the cryptocurrency/map endpoint. This endpoint also returns the supported date ranges for historical conversions via the first_historical_data and last_historical_data properties.
Conversions are supported in 93 different fiat currencies and 4 precious metals as outlined here. Historical fiat conversions are supported as far back as 2013-04-28.
A last_updated timestamp is included for both your source currency and each conversion currency. This is the timestamp of the closest market rate record referenced for each currency during the conversion.

This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic (Latest market price conversions)
Hobbyist (Latest market price conversions + 1 month historical)
Startup (Latest market price conversions + 1 month historical)
Standard (Latest market price conversions + 3 months historical)
Professional (Latest market price conversions + 12 months historical)
Enterprise (Latest market price conversions + up to 6 years historical)

Cache / Update frequency: Every 60 seconds for the lastest cryptocurrency and fiat currency rates.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per call and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our cryptocurrency conversion page at coinmarketcap.com/converter/.

An amount of currency to convert. Example: 10.43
The CoinMarketCap currency ID of the base cryptocurrency or fiat to convert from. Example: "1"
Alternatively the currency symbol of the base cryptocurrency or fiat to convert from. Example: "BTC". One "id" or "symbol" is required. Please note that starting in the v2 endpoint, due to the fact that a symbol is not unique, if you request by symbol each quote response will contain an array of objects containing all of the coins that use each requested symbol. The v1 endpoint will still return a single object, the highest ranked coin using that symbol.
Optional timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to reference historical pricing during conversion. If not passed, the current time will be used. If passed, we'll reference the closest historic values available for this conversion.
Pass up to 120 comma-separated fiat or cryptocurrency symbols to convert the source amount to.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

MARKET PAIRS LATEST V1 (DEPRECATED)

Lists all active market pairs that CoinMarketCap tracks for a given cryptocurrency or fiat currency. All markets with this currency as the pair base or pair quote will be returned. The latest price and volume information is returned for each market. Use the "convert" option to return market values in multiple fiat and cryptocurrency conversions in the same call.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 1 minute.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 market pairs returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our active cryptocurrency markets pages like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets.

A cryptocurrency or fiat currency by CoinMarketCap ID to list market pairs for. Example: "1"
Alternatively pass a cryptocurrency by slug. Example: "bitcoin"
Alternatively pass a cryptocurrency by symbol. Fiat currencies are not supported by this field. Example: "BTC". A single cryptocurrency "id", "slug", or "symbol" is required.
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.
Optionally specify the sort direction of markets returned.
Optionally specify the sort order of markets returned. By default we return a strict sort on 24 hour reported volume. Pass cmc_rank to return a CMC methodology based sort where markets with excluded volumes are returned last.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass num_market_pairs,category,fee_type,market_url,currency_name,currency_slug,price_quote,notice,cmc_rank,effective_liquidity,market_score,market_reputation to include all auxiliary fields.
Optionally include one or more fiat or cryptocurrency IDs to filter market pairs by. For example ?id=1&matched_id=2781 would only return BTC markets that matched: "BTC/USD" or "USD/BTC". This parameter cannot be used when matched_symbol is used.
Optionally include one or more fiat or cryptocurrency symbols to filter market pairs by. For example ?symbol=BTC&matched_symbol=USD would only return BTC markets that matched: "BTC/USD" or "USD/BTC". This parameter cannot be used when matched_id is used.
The category of trading this market falls under. Spot markets are the most common but options include derivatives and OTC.
The fee type the exchange enforces for this market.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

OHLCV HISTORICAL V1 (DEPRECATED)

Returns historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data along with market cap for any cryptocurrency using time interval parameters. Currently daily and hourly OHLCV periods are supported. Volume is not currently supported for hourly OHLCV intervals before 2020-09-22.
Technical Notes

Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time for this "time_period".
One OHLCV quote will be returned for every "time_period" between your "time_start" (exclusive) and "time_end" (inclusive).
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "time_period" will be calculated in reverse from "time_end" using the "count" parameter which defaults to 10 results.
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
If you don't need every "time_period" between your dates you may adjust the frequency that "time_period" is sampled using the "interval" parameter. For example with "time_period" set to "daily" you may set "interval" to "2d" to get the daily OHLCV for every other day. You could set "interval" to "monthly" to get the first daily OHLCV for each month, or set it to "yearly" to get the daily OHLCV value against the same date every year.

Implementation Tips

If querying for a specific OHLCV date your "time_start" should specify a timestamp of 1 interval prior as "time_start" is an exclusive time parameter (as opposed to "time_end" which is inclusive to the search). This means that when you pass a "time_start" results will be returned for the next complete "time_period". For example, if you are querying for a daily OHLCV datapoint for 2018-11-30 your "time_start" should be "2018-11-29".
If only specifying a "count" parameter to return latest OHLCV periods, your "count" should be 1 number higher than the number of results you expect to receive. "Count" defines the number of "time_period" intervals queried, not the number of results to return, and this includes the currently active time period which is incomplete when working backwards from current time. For example, if you want the last daily OHLCV value available simply pass "count=2" to skip the incomplete active time period.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.

Interval Options
There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "time_period" and "interval" parameters. For "time_period" these return aggregate OHLCV data from the beginning to end of each interval period. Apply these time intervals to "interval" to adjust how frequently "time_period" is sampled.
The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Hour intervals in UTC.
"daily" - Calendar day intervals for each UTC day.
"weekly" - Calendar week intervals for each calendar week.
"monthly" - Calendar month intervals for each calendar month.
"yearly" - Calendar year intervals for each calendar year.
The second are relative time intervals.
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Time periods that repeat every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".
Please note that "time_period" currently supports the "daily" and "hourly" options. "interval" supports all interval options.

Cache / Update frequency: Latest Daily OHLCV record is available ~5 to ~10 minutes after each midnight UTC. The latest hourly OHLCV record is available 5 minutes after each UTC hour.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 OHLCV data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical cryptocurrency data pages like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/.
One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs. Example: "1,1027"
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request.
Time period to return OHLCV data for. The default is "daily". If hourly, the open will be 01:00 and the close will be 01:59. If daily, the open will be 00:00:00 for the day and close will be 23:59:99 for the same day. See the main endpoint description for details.
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to start returning OHLCV time periods for. Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time.
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to stop returning OHLCV time periods for (inclusive). Optional, if not passed we'll default to the current time. Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time.
Optionally limit the number of time periods to return results for. The default is 10 items. The current query limit is 10000 items.
Optionally adjust the interval that "time_period" is sampled. For example with interval=monthly&time_period=daily you will see a daily OHLCV record for January, February, March and so on. See main endpoint description for available options.
By default market quotes are returned in USD. Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 3 fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

OHLCV LATEST V1 (DEPRECATED)

Returns the latest OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) market values for one or more cryptocurrencies for the current UTC day. Since the current UTC day is still active these values are updated frequently. You can find the final calculated OHLCV values for the last completed UTC day along with all historic days using /cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 10 minutes. Additional OHLCV intervals and 1 minute updates will be available in the future.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 OHLCV values returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: No equivalent, this data is only available via API.

CMC equivalent pages: No equivalent, this data is only available via API.
One or more comma-separated cryptocurrency CoinMarketCap IDs. Example: 1,2
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "symbol" is required.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

PRICE PERFORMANCE STATS V1 (DEPRECATED)

Returns price performance statistics for one or more cryptocurrencies including launch price ROI and all-time high / all-time low. Stats are returned for an all_time period by default. UTC yesterday and a number of rolling time periods may be requested using the time_period parameter. Utilize the convert parameter to translate values into multiple fiats or cryptocurrencies using historical rates.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 60 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 cryptocurrencies returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: The statistics module displayed on cryptocurrency pages like Bitcoin.
NOTE: You may also use /cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical for traditional OHLCV data at historical daily and hourly intervals. You may also use /v1/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/latest for OHLCV data for the current UTC day.

NOTE: You may also use /cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical for traditional OHLCV data at historical daily and hourly intervals. You may also use /v1/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/latest for OHLCV data for the current UTC day.
One or more comma-separated cryptocurrency CoinMarketCap IDs. Example: 1,2
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request.
Specify one or more comma-delimited time periods to return stats for. all_time is the default. Pass all_time,yesterday,24h,7d,30d,90d,365d to return all supported time periods. All rolling periods have a rolling close time of the current request time. For example 24h would have a close time of now and an open time of 24 hours before now. Please note: yesterday is a UTC period and currently does not currently support high and low timestamps.
Optionally calculate quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if no match is found for 1 or more requested cryptocurrencies. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

QUOTES HISTORICAL V1 (DEPRECATED)

Returns an interval of historic market quotes for any cryptocurrency based on time and interval parameters.
Technical Notes

A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.

Implementation Tips

Want to get the last quote of each UTC day? Don't use "interval=daily" as that returns the first quote. Instead use "interval=24h" to repeat a specific timestamp search every 24 hours and pass ex. "time_start=2019-01-04T23:59:00.000Z" to query for the last record of each UTC day.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.

Interval Options 
There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".
The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
"daily" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
"weekly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
"monthly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
"yearly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.
The second are relative time intervals.
"m": Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Get the first quote available every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist (1 month)
Startup (1 month)
Standard (3 month)
Professional (12 months)
Enterprise (Up to 6 years)

Cache / Update frequency: Every 5 minutes.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 historical data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical cryptocurrency charts like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts.

Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 historical data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical cryptocurrency charts like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts.
One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs. Example: "1,2"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "symbol" is required for this request.
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to start returning quotes for. Optional, if not passed, we'll return quotes calculated in reverse from "time_end".
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to stop returning quotes for (inclusive). Optional, if not passed, we'll default to the current time. If no "time_start" is passed, we return quotes in reverse order starting from this time.
The number of interval periods to return results for. Optional, required if both "time_start" and "time_end" aren't supplied. The default is 10 items. The current query limit is 10000.
Interval of time to return data points for. See details in endpoint description.
By default market quotes are returned in USD. Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 3 other fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass price,volume,market_cap,circulating_supply,total_supply,quote_timestamp,is_active,is_fiat,search_interval to include all auxiliary fields.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if no match is found for 1 or more requested cryptocurrencies. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

QUOTES LATEST V1 (DEPRECATED)

Returns the latest market quote for 1 or more cryptocurrencies. Use the "convert" option to return market values in multiple fiat and cryptocurrency conversions in the same call.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Startup
Hobbyist
Standard
Professional
Enterprise

Cache / Update frequency: Every 60 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 cryptocurrencies returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Latest market data pages for specific cryptocurrencies like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/.
NOTE: Use this endpoint to request the latest quote for specific cryptocurrencies. If you need to request all cryptocurrencies use /v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest which is optimized for that purpose. The response data between these endpoints is otherwise the same.

One or more comma-separated cryptocurrency CoinMarketCap IDs. Example: 1,2
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request.
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass num_market_pairs,cmc_rank,date_added,tags,platform,max_supply,circulating_supply,total_supply,market_cap_by_total_supply,volume_24h_reported,volume_7d,volume_7d_reported,volume_30d,volume_30d_reported,is_active,is_fiat to include all auxiliary fields.
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if no match is found for 1 or more requested cryptocurrencies. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.
